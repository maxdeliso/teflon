## Teflon ##

Teflon is a simple peer to peer chat application implemented in java.
It was written to demonstrate the ugliness of the java programming language.
The eventual plan is to port this code to a series of other languages.

### Howto ###

If you want to build and run this code, but don't know how, then don't despair: it's really easy. 
Install [eclipse](http://eclipse.org/), and [egit](http://eclipse.org/egit/).
Then, run eclipse, and select File -> Import -> Git -> From URI, and then enter the public URI for this project: git://github.com/maxdeliso/teflon.git
That's it! 

Because the repository includes a .project file and some other things, it should automatically build (unless I've messed it up).

### Bugs ###

If you do a build and you find that there is an error in the code which needs to be fixed, are unwilling or unable to fix it yourself, but still care enough to take some action, submit it in the form of an issue to the following URL: https://github.com/maxdeliso/teflon/issues  
If you fix a bug that you found, please submit a merge request.
